# PyConnector

**`pyconnector`**: Bridge the gap between Node.JS and Python applications

Both [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) have their own unique strengths and weaknesses 
when it comes to developing applications. This module provides a simple and crude interface to embed and use Python code 
for number crunching queries.

## Installation

Just type `npm install pyconnector` and you are ready to go.

## Usage




## Background

PyConnector is intended to be used for rapid prototyping within POC applications. For production and advanced use cases, its
recommended to use this [ZeroMQ package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zeromq), which this module heavily relies upon.
