# PyConnector
=============

**`pyconnector`**: Bridge the gap between Node.JS and Python applications

Both [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) have their own unique strengths and weaknesses 
when it comes to developing applications. This module provides a simple and crude interface to embed and use Python code 
for number crunching queries.


## Installation
------

Just type `npm install pyconnector` and you are ready to go.


## Background
-------

PyConnector is intended to be used for rapid prototyping within POC applications. For production and advanced use cases, its
recommended to use [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) Node.JS bindings, which this module already relies upon.
